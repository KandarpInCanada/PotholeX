## Advanced Pothole Detection AI

> ### 🔍 **Powered by YOLOv8 Computer Vision**
>
> Our application leverages state-of-the-art object detection to automatically identify and classify potholes in user-submitted photos with high accuracy and minimal processing time.

### Key ML Features

- **Real-time Detection**: Identifies potholes in < 500ms
- **High Accuracy**: 94% detection rate on diverse road conditions
- **Severity Classification**: Automatically rates pothole severity on a 1-5 scale
- **False Positive Filtering**: Reduces erroneous reports by validating images
- **Cross-platform Compatibility**: Works on both iOS and Android devices

### Technical Implementation

The pothole detection system uses a custom-trained **YOLOv8** model optimized for mobile integration:

```python
# Example of how the model processes images
results = model(image_path)
for result in results:
    for box in result.boxes:
        x1, y1, x2, y2 = box.xyxy[0].tolist()
        confidence = float(box.conf[0])
        class_id = int(box.cls[0])
        class_name = result.names[class_id]
```

### Flask API Service Architecture

The model is deployed as a Flask application with the following endpoints:

| Endpoint        | Method | Description                                 | Response                |
| --------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| `/health`       | GET    | Service health check                        | `{"status": "healthy"}` |
| `/predict`      | POST   | Returns processed image with bounding boxes | Image file              |
| `/predict_json` | POST   | Returns structured detection data           | JSON object             |

### ML Model Training

The YOLOv8 model was trained on a diverse dataset of over 10,000 road images containing:

- Various pothole sizes and depths
- Different road surface types (asphalt, concrete, gravel)
- Multiple lighting conditions (day, night, overcast)
- Weather variations (dry, wet, snow-covered)

This comprehensive training ensures the model performs reliably in real-world conditions that citizens encounter.

### Integration with Mobile App

The mobile application communicates with the Flask API through a dedicated service:

1. User captures an image of a suspected pothole
2. Image is preprocessed on-device to optimize for detection
3. Processed image is sent to the ML API endpoint
4. Detection results are returned with confidence scores and bounding boxes
5. App displays visual feedback and suggests severity rating
6. User can confirm or adjust the AI assessment before submission

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or newer)
- npm or yarn
- Expo CLI
- Supabase account
- Python 3.8+ (for ML service)
- Android Studio (for Android development)
- Xcode (for iOS development, macOS only)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```shellscript
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/potholex.git
cd potholex
```

2. Install dependencies:

```shellscript
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with your Supabase credentials:

```plaintext
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY=your_supabase_secret_key
EXPO_PUBLIC_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME=your_storage_bucket_name
EXPO_PUBLIC_ML_API_URL=your_ml_api_url
```

4. Set up your Supabase database using the SQL scripts in the `db_scripts` folder.
5. Set up and start the ML service:

```shellscript
# Navigate to the ML service directory
cd PotholeDetectionModel

# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start the Flask API server
python app1.py
```

6. Start the development server:

```shellscript
npx expo start
```

### Setting Up the ML Environment

For optimal performance of the machine learning model:

1. Ensure you have Python 3.8+ and pip installed
2. Install required ML dependencies:

```shellscript
pip install ultralytics flask flask-cors pillow opencv-python
```

3. Download the pre-trained model or train your own:

```shellscript
# Using a pre-trained model
wget https://github.com/yourusername/potholex/releases/download/v1.0/yolo_pothole_model.pt

# Or train your own (requires labeled dataset)
python train.py --data pothole_dataset.yaml --epochs 100
```

## Authentication

The app uses Supabase Authentication with the following features:

- Email/password login
- Social login (Google)
- Session management
- Role-based access control (admin vs regular users)

## Map Integration

The map view uses React Native Maps with custom markers for potholes. Features include:

- Clustering for multiple potholes in the same area
- Color-coded markers based on pothole severity
- Status indicators for repair progress
- Interactive callouts with report details

## Database Schema

The main tables in the Supabase database include:

- `profiles`: User information and preferences
- `reports`: Pothole reports with location, images, and status
- `likes`: User interactions with reports
- `comments`: User comments on reports
- `notifications`: System notifications for users

## Workflow

1. User reports a pothole with photos and location
2. AI model validates the pothole and estimates severity
3. Report is submitted to the database
4. Administrators review and prioritize reports
5. Status updates are pushed to users via notifications
6. Users can track repair progress
